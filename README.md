Game Title:

Hacktoberfest Hunt



Game Description:
	
The game consists of a chessboard-like field with the 'Hacktoberfest' word hidden.
Each time the user selects a tile, it will flip and show the content under it.
The tile will either display a cross sign or a letter present in the 'Hacktoberfest' word. There
will be a player and an opponent (bot or friend). The person who strikes all the words
first will win the prize (i.e. a Hacktoberfest T-shirt).



Rules:

1. Only one tile can be selected at a time.
2. The person who selects the tile with correct letters of the word will get another turn.
3. The person who selects all the letters of 'Hacktoberfest' will win the game.



Special Moves:

There would be three items which represent special moves.
1. First would allow to play an extra turn even though the guess was wrong.
2. Second would allow the user to flip the tiles' position before the user can perform the moves.
3. Provide hint of the opponents' position the tile.
4. Each move can be used only once.




Note: 

1.Instead of classic chessboard tiles, Digital Ocean's cloud logo with different colours could be used.
2.Hacktoberfest stickers could be used to represent the special move indicators.
